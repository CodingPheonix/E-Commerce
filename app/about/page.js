                Welcome to our demo eCommerce store! This project is a simple showcase
                built to demonstrate how an online shopping experience could look and
                feel. While the products aren’t real, the goal is to provide a clean,
                modern interface that represents a basic shopping application.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
                We focus on usability, minimalism, and clarity—perfect for learning,
                experimenting, or expanding into a full-featured application.
